## Getting Started
This project uses AndroidX dependencies.
This means you would need to have Android Studio 3.2.1 or later and AndroidX installed. With this, you can get started with the following steps:
1. Clone this project
    `git clone https://github.com/chydee/PokemonGO-Android-App.git`
2. Launch and build project on Android studio.

To test this application, please use an Android device or emulator (OS 5.0 or newer).

## WHAT WAS DONE:
**Understand the Task** - Before proceeding with coding the features I had to understand the problem, how to approach it,
  ways to achieve what was expected.
**Leveraging on resources to make process faster** - I Google some concepts and also search stackoverflow for possible solutions to problems I faced

## WHAT I WOULD DO BETTER:
 If I had enough time I'd have created my own custom camera with a custom interface to suit my need and and tailor it to have the look and feel as modeled in the design.
