## WHAT WAS DONE:
**Understand the Task** - Before proceeding with coding the features I had to understand the problem, how to approach it,
  ways to achieve what was expected.
**Leveraged on resources to make process faster** - I Google some concepts and also search stackoverflow for possible solutions to problems I faced

## WHAT I WOULD DO BETTER:
 If I had enough time I'd have written Unit, Integration and UI tests for the different classes, fragments and/or activities implemented
